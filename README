D Bindings for Cairo

Alterations to Original interface:

cairo_bool_t just uses a D bool.

enum names
    All enums are now in a different format. This is because accessing D enum members requires
    specifing the type name, which with C-style namespacing results in needing, for example
    cairo_status_t.CAIRO_STATUS_SUCCESS in D. All members of enums are now shortened to the actual
    name and camel-cased. Since typical C usage is, for example, CAIRO_STATUS_SUCCESS, enums has
    been renamed so this is valid: CairoStatus.Success
    The documentation names have not been changed
